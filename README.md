# Wine Products

This web page has been prepared for the technical challge of Segmentify.
The product information is taken from the data.json file and the properties of the wines selected according to certain criteria are shown in this web page.

# Tools 

This project is written with HTML, CSS and pure JS and used the Jquery library. 


# Parts to be completed

There are 2 problems I will fix in this code;
    1. The products need to be on the same line.
    2. When I add the slider, the individual cards must loop, but the products rotate within themselves.
